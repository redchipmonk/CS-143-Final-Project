# CS-143-Final-Project
<p>By Alvin Le and Eric Im</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This program simulates a recommendation system for movies with 
features like search, filter, explore, add, and remove. 
The search feature allows the user to search a movie based on title. 
The filter feature allows the user to search for movies by genre. 
The explore feature takes the user to a page to take a survey and recommends movies 
based on the choices the user made on the survey. 
The add feature allows the user to add a movie to our Movie Recommender program. 
Once the movie is added into program, the program can recommend movies based on user input.
The added movie is saved into our "Movies.txt" file.
The remove feature allows the user to remove a movie from our Movie Recommender program.
On the main page of the program, when the user clicks on the title of a movie, it lists
information about the movie and the 3 recommended movies that are similar to that movie.</p>

<h3>How to Run</h3>
<p>Run the program in the RecommendationMain.java method. 
it should read from the "movies.txt" file and "survey.txt" file included in the zip. folder.
You can search, filter, add, remove movies. 
When adding movies, make sure you put an existing genre, or year to get 
the right recommendation of movies for that particular movie.
explore button makes you take a survey, and depending on those surveys,
it recommends movie pertaining to those category of choices.
